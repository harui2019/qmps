## Forked-Branch Note

Due to the master branch of the original repository being outdated, this forked branch is used to update the code to work with the latest version of the Qiskit and Cirq library to reproduce the paper's result.

All testing will save in the folder `playground` and the results will be saved in the folder `playground/results`.
